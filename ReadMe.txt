David database project

I have created a relationship diagram that show the connections between
the vetcaredb databases. The diagram shows all the tables data types.
It also shows the primary key and the foreign keys

For creating the sql to build and populate databases. It creates the tables
using the help of the diagram. All the tables have primary keys. All the tables 
have a foreign keys except for the petowner table. The values have inserted 
values. The foreign keys have a constraint with cascade. The cascade will allow
changes to happen to records in table.

The php files work correctly showing the queries for the tables. The joins are 
possible with the help of primary keys and foreign keys. The host is the localhost and user is 
root.

There are seven queries in total that display all the tables and rows for the vet databases.
